# Web-Scraping-using-Python
I have used Python to scrap the data. I have taken product of Apple Iphone 11 and scraped the details like name, price, available colours, available storages, etc using BeautifulSoap library. Then, I have saved the details in csv format and sent the same to my mail.

i have attached the python file(.ipynb) in this repository to view the code.

Thanks.
